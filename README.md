# Longest word chain

It just a exercise work after watch this informative video [Exploring Word Chains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuqNrV8LsQ) by [CodeParade](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeParade)

## Details

1. Read the `6of12.txt` file from [12Dicts Package](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts)
2. Select the words with regular expression
3. Create an adjecent matrix
4. Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to get the shortest distance between each word
5. Get the maximum distance from the result
6. Use the maximum distance to find the longest word chain
